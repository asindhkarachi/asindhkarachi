        <h1 style="color: orange;">MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS </h1>
        <p>Happiness through the lens of Islam is of two kinds: Happiness in this world and happiness in the hereafter.

            The Qur’an does not disparage the life of this world. God states:
            
            “It is He who created all that is on this earth for you.”
            (Qur’an 53:25)
            
            “Eat from what your Lord has provided for you and give Him thanks.”
            (Qur’an 34:15)
            
            “Do not neglect your rightful share in this world.”
            (Qur’an 28:77)
            
            Thus, while believers enjoy the goods of this world, they work towards the higher goods of the next. Happiness depends on our attitude to this world, and how we live in it. If we are engrossed in the material world and take it as an end in and of itself, we will forget the ultimate purpose of our creation.
            
            According to al-Ghazali, the moderate way of living is like the lives of the Prophets, since it fulfills both the needs of this world and the hereafter:
            
            Know, the happiness of everything—its pleasure, its serenity—indeed the pleasure of everything accords with the needs of its nature. The nature of everything accords with what it has been created for. The eye delights in [seeing] pretty pictures and the ear delights in [hearing] harmonious sounds. Every limb can be described like this. The heart’s distinctive delight is in the knowledge of God, the Most High, because the heart is created from it [divine knowledge].</p>
            <br><br>
            
            <p> Islam provides a sense of purpose and emotional fulfillment through attachment to God. Spirituality and religiosity are also associated with better mental health and have been identified as essential aspects of preventing and treating mental illness.

    Islamic spirituality provides ultimate purpose and meaning to human life—two aspects central to human flourishing and maintaining a healthy emotional state. At Islam’s core is the concept of servitude, surrender, and submission to the Divine. And, in doing so, we are, counterintuitively presented with the opportunity to attain true freedom and liberation from the shackles of this world.
    
    The freedom and relief that comes from this surrender through worship has been shown to have profound effects on the brain. Through daily prayer (salah), supplication (du’a), and God’s remembrance (dhikr), we are provided with constant sources of protection and avenues for therapeutic relief. Within the idea of submission is also the notion of Divine Destiny (qadar)—the belief that everything that happens to us is part of God’s just, wise, and compassionate plan. This shifts our thinking from agonizing over questions like “Why Me?” or “What did I do to deserve this?” to more self-empowering frameworks that offer hope, a deepened sense of God-consciousness, and solace in the Qur’an.
    
    Through this framework, Islam provides the strongest anchor by which to navigate life: a deep attachment to God.
<br><br>
<p>Yes. Various types of mental illness have been discussed by Muslim scholars for centuries. Contemporary scholars recognize the need for both spiritual and clinical treatments to address mental health struggles.

    Many Muslim scholars have dedicated their lives to exploring the spiritual and psychological dimensions of human well-being and flourishing—including aspects that would fall under the contemporary classification of mental health.
    
    In the fields of clinical psychology and psychiatry, many practitioners increasingly recognize the role of spirituality as an essential part of both the prevention and treatment of mental illness. A systematic review of multiple studies showed that increased levels of spirituality and religiosity in adolescence correlated with better mental health.
    
    It should be clarified, however, that in discussing the beneficial role that spirituality and psycho-spiritual therapy (such as prayer) can have on mental health and well-being, we do not intend to minimize other forms of treatment. This delicate balance was understood by Muslim scholars centuries before the development of modern psychiatry. For instance, the 14th century scholar Ibn al-Qayyim writes that, “The second category of diseases of the heart are based on emotional states such as anxiety, sadness, depression, and anger. These types of ailment can be treated naturally by treating the cause or with medicine that goes against the cause…and this is because the heart is harmed by what harms the body and vice versa.”</p>
<br><br>
,p>Islamic texts acknowledge the validity of negative emotions and offer guidelines on how to deal with them in a healthy way.

One of the first steps Islam takes in navigating such emotions is to reorient our perspective: The Qur’an reminds us not to allow ourselves to become or remain overly attached to this world and its distractions, and that the pursuit of virtue will lead to ultimate happiness in the Hereafter:

“Wealth and children are the adornments of the life of this world, but that which endures, [such as] righteous deeds, is better in reward with thy Lord, and better [as a source] of hope.”
(Qur’an 18:46)

It is normal to experience sadness and grief (even intensely), and, just as Allah gave us life, He gave us emotions. These emotions can in fact be beneficial and a means of drawing nearer to God if dealt with appropriately.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Islamic teachings validate negative emotions and mindsets, and from these teachings we can derive practical tips to overcome them.

    The Qur’an describes human nature as prone to anxiety and fear:
    
    “Truly, man was created anxious; when evil befalls him, fretful; when good befalls him, begrudging, except for those who perform prayer.”
    (Qur’an 70:19-22)
    
    Some practical steps from the Islamic tradition to deal with negative emotions include:
    
    Practice the sunnah of husn al-dhann (having a good opinion of others). Give others (and yourself!) excuses and try to understand where your thoughts or emotions might be coming from. Also understand that other peoples’ actions may not be a reflection of their feelings towards you, but a reflection of their own negative experiences.
    Recall the Prophet ﷺ and the difficulties he endured compared to your own.
    Remind yourself that there are great blessings and opportunities in difficulties and suffering, and that it is God’s promise that we will be tested by things that may cause us anxiety, grief, a sense of loss, and more:
    
    “We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure…”
    (Qur’an 2:155)
    
    Lastly, strive to remember that Allah is always with you, even if it feels like the entire world is against you.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Yes, the Qur’an uses stories to provide relatability and offers coping strategies to feel better about temporary negativity and distress.

        The Qur’an tells the stories of many individuals who experienced profound distress and other negative emotions, and provides priceless guidance on how we may overcome these emotions. The Qur’an teaches us that even the greatest of people, from God’s prophets and messengers to saintly men and women, experienced periods of profound distress, grief, or sorrow. We can learn from this that such emotions are a normal part of the human experience. Just as Allah gave us life, He also gave us emotions.
        
        Seeking solace by visualizing the promise of eternal, untainted happiness in Paradise compared with the temporary nature of this life, striving to remember God frequently and engage in dhikr, and turning to God with your complaints and pains in prayer and supplication are all actions inspired by Quranic guidance that help us through negative emotions. Additionally, seeking out the support of groups or trusted individuals (such as grief and bereavement support groups) who have gone through similar experiences may provide needed validation and catharsis.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>While terms such as “meditation” may evoke certain images and connotations that are not Islamic, Muslims are encouraged (and in some cases obligated) to engage in practices and cultivate inwards states and qualities that could be described as meditative.
        These practices include prayer as well as other mindfulness practices such as tafakkur (deliberate contemplation), dhikr (remembrance of God), silence, and muraqaba (mindfulness), among others.
        With respect to prayer, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ himself stated that, of all things made beloved to him in life, “the coolness of [his] eyes” or “[his] tranquility” has been placed in prayer. When he felt overwhelmed or troubled, he instinctively and routinely sought refuge in God through prayer.
        On one specific occasion, the Prophet ﷺ asked his Companion, Bilal, to call the people to prayer by saying, “give us comfort by it, oh Bilal…”</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Yes, mindfulness and meditation are integral to Islam.

        The Prophet ﷺ embodied what it means to be a mindful Muslim. He would frequently retreat to a quiet place of seclusion (Cave Hira) even before receiving the message of Islam. There, he found clarity and refuge. It was during one of these meditative moments that he received the miraculous revelation of the Qur’an.
        
        In Islam, mindfulness and meditation are tied to the concept of muraqabah: a comprehensive form of self-awareness that is deeply intertwined with God-consciousness. It is the idea of living and being in the world as the Divine designed in order to attain true presence and reach higher states of spiritual strength and connectedness, especially in prayer.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Mindfulness is to be completely aware of and mindful of God at all times, and as a result to perform as many good actions as possible.In the Islamic context, mindfulness is the virtue of muraqabah, a word which is derived from the root meaning “to watch, observe, regard attentively.” As a technical spiritual term, it is defined as “the constant knowledge of the servant and conviction in the supervision of the Truth, glory be to Him, over one’s outward and inward states.” A Muslim in a state of muraqabah is in continuous full knowledge that God is Aware of him or her, inwardly and outwardly.

            Muraqabah is a complete state of self-awareness in your relationship with God in the heart, mind, and body. Knowing that God is always watching, we develop greater attention to our actions, thoughts, feelings, and inner states of being. Muraqabah is also the fulfillment of worshipping God with a proper understanding of His beautiful names, such that they guide us to be more intentional with our actions. As God says in the Qur’an,
            
            “Remember that God knows what is in your souls, so be mindful of Him.”
            
            Ibn al-Qayyim and Al-Ghazali both have chapters in their books about the merits and realities of muraqabah. It is not just a recommended character trait, but a realization of the supreme character trait, spiritual excellence (al-ihsan). As the Prophet ﷺ defined in the famous hadith of Gabriel, spiritual excellence “is to worship God as if you can see Him, for if you do not see Him, He certainly sees you.” In other words, spiritual excellence is to be completely aware and mindful of God at all times—the very peak of faith.
            
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>THE DUHA APPROACH is one example of how our religious tradition offers guidance on dealing with trauma and pain.

                This approach is based on the chapter of the Quran known as ad-Duha (The Dawn). This chapter was revealed during a particularly difficult period in the life of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ that was marked by profound sadness and anxiety. By reflecting on the surah and deriving lessons from it, we hope it can serve as a blueprint for how one may overcome and healthily manage things like suffering and trauma. Each of the steps in the Duha Approach mirrors the structure of the chapter itself:
                
                The first step in the Duha Approach is to establish a sense of attachment and connection to Allah. Experiencing hardships or trauma is not necessarily a sign of God hating you, as even the greatest of human beings—such as the Prophet ﷺ—experienced severe difficulties.
                
              
                The second step is to shift perspective and remind ourselves that no matter what we may be experiencing now, it will pass, just as this world itself will one day pass. The Hereafter and its promises of reward and permanent contentment far outweigh the brief hardships of this world. The chapter then provides an example of what might be similar to a technique in cognitive therapy: seeking to reshape how we view and interpret our current state of affairs. This surah does so by diverting the Prophet’s ﷺ attention away from his present difficulties and instead reminding him of the blessings Allah has bestowed upon him, and of His guidance and care for him. The next step is to take action to better our patterns of behavior and thus our mindsets. And lastly, this approach encourages the cultivation of gratitude. Consistently acknowledging things that are worth being grateful for which can radically improve our general state of being.</p>
               <br><br>
                <p> We constantly juggle multiple roles in our life. As a family member, professional and a friend, we deal with a variety of situations. Not only does this challenge us to be emotionally smart, it also challenges us to avoid the trap of a negative emotional state. So we need to make a choice to master our emotions. Do we handle our emotions or will our emotions handle us?

                Let’s take a look at an example.
                
                It’s a common scenario for a husband to quarrel with his wife because of work stress. These unfair and undue outbursts damage our personality and relations. How do we ensure that we are in control of our emotions to purify our hearts and protect the relationships we have with others?
                
                 Step 1: Recognise and Accept that You Are in Control of Your Emotions
                First, we need to convince ourselves that we are in full control of our emotions. We cannot blame anyone else for any emotion residing inside of us. Of course, there can be external triggers, unexpected events and piled up work. All of these are beyond our control, but what remains within the hold of our fist is how we react to all this craziness.
                
                It is interesting to note how we tune ourselves to react in a certain way in a given scenario. For instance, we have programmed ourselves to get angry if someone horns at us during traffic rush hour. We have programmed ourselves to shout back if someone uses a harsh tone with us. And interestingly enough, we have programmed ourselves to smile and relax when someone says, “Sorry”.
                
                By doing this, we become a puppet in control of words, tones and scenarios. If we start emotionally detaching ourselves from these triggers that we have programmed ourselves with, we can be more intelligent in crisis situations. People who react to every word and action coming their way are so caught up in dealing with their emotions, that they waste major part of their energy and time entangled in this self-created state of mind.
                
                Step 2: Identify the Reasons for Emotional Outbursts
                Love of world
                Controlling our reactions is important. Equally important is the need to take a closer look at our lifestyles. Too much love of worldly possessions creates fear of loss and depression. So limit your wants by knowing your needs. Avoid indulgence.
                Lack of proper nutrition
                Eating inorganic, fast food and lack of routine in proper eating habits causes bad mood. If one does not eat at proper intervals, or if one starves for too long only to fill up the stomach with junk food, then the brain is confused to the extent that it treats hunger as stress. The body responds to hunger not by eating (because it is not trained to), but rather by shouting, screaming and showing irritation.
                Lack of proper sleep
                Agitation is also a common reaction to sleep deprivation. A healthy, sound sleep makes us happy and relaxed. By staying up for too long we become irritable and angry.One more important factor that keeps people away from emotional stability is uncontrolled thoughts. Have you ever noticed that your last thought before going to sleep is the first one that you have when you wake up? Our brain is engaged the whole night nurturing our thoughts. So make a dua, thank Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and think positive as you lie down to sleep. Avoid horror movies or late night talks.
                Step 3: Take Positive Action to Manage Your Emotions
                Counsel yourself
                Some people spend the whole day wondering if their neighbour’s laughing at them, if people like their shoes, if someone thinks they are stupid etc. Avoid suspicion and rid yourself on any thought that keeps recurring endlessly.Another great way to reduce emotional crisis is to keep looking at the bigger picture. Keep telling yourself that this world and everything in it is a timely setup – a trial for our character and it will all go away. Having faith in Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and gratitude towards the smallest of blessings He has granted us can help us stay positive with what life has to offer us.”For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease. Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease” [Qur’an: Chapter 94, Verses 5-6].
                Take control of your mind
                Think about a joke that you heard years ago and you will find yourself laughing, as if you are heard that joke for the first time. Think about a tragedy you faced and you will find tears in your eyes.None of these two situations exist in reality right now, but our brain assumes they do. So if we can control our imagination, we can control those negative thoughts that strike us day in and day out, and then we can spend our whole life smiling while others wonder how we do that!A very effective way of controlling evil whispering away is to recite Surah Al-Falaq [Qur’an: Chapter 113, Verses 1-5] and Surah An-Nas [Qur’an: Chapter 114, Verses 1-6].There is always a brighter side to things that disturb us. Try to practice positive thinking, and if you still can’t see anything good about it, then it is an opportunity for you to practice patience and tawakkal.
                Remember Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He)
                If you find yourself over reacting to certain events, try keeping a specific dhikr for it. Dhikr keeps the heart alive.For example you can read Kalimah Tawheed when waiting for someone, or Surah Al-Ikhlas [Qur’an: Chapter 112, Verses 1-4] when angry. You can also read ayat Al-Kursi [Qur’an: Chapter 2, Verse 255] when happy and perform sujud when you hear a good news. You can train yourself to do tawbah when distressed or sick.
                Practice forgiveness
                The best way to come to terms with your emotions is to let go, move on and to not drag your emotional burdens with the intention to take revenge. There is no evil you can do without hurting yourself first, and there is no good that you can do without benefiting yourself. So do yourself a favour by forgiving and moving on.”And those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, and when they are angry, they forgive” [Qur’an: Chapter 42, Verse 37]
                Follow the seerah
                Prophet Muhammad ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) was the most stable personality in the history of mankind. We see an amazing balance of emotions in his seerah. The way he dealt with things is a role model for us.When Muslims won the battle of Badr and returned home, the Prophet ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) was told that his daughter had passed away. He did not highlight his sorrow, he did not mourn on it. He let the Muslims celebrate the victory.However during the conquest of Makkah, he did not get carried away by vindictiveness or elation. His head was down, he was remembering Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and he granted everyone a general amnesty.
                Manage your time
                We find ourselves badly tied up in stress, depression and sorrow when we are late for a deadline. Planning properly and doing things in time is the best way to keep your life in control. Do not procrastinate.Also remember, if you find doing something is easy now, take advantage of it. For it does not mean that it will always remain easy. So make the best use of the time as it is one of the biggest blessings of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He).
                Always communicate honestly
                When nothing works, at least speak up. Voice it out to the people around you intelligently and politely, so they will know how you feel. It will give you the space you need until you feel emotionally stable again.But be careful in choosing the best words and best ways to let people know how you feel. Don’t let it become your weak point if you know that the other party can be manipulative, and don’t burst out in shouts and sarcasm as a defence. If people around you care for you, they will certainly facilitate, and in return you can be empathetic to them when they go through a bad time.Emotional crisis is an illusion created by human mind. Stress is not real: if it were a real thing like gravity, it would effect everyone the same way quantitatively. However these emotional crisis eat away our bottom lines. They affect our mental health, personalities and attitudes. To deal with them, the three golden principles are:Avoid: If there is an appropriate way to avoid the situation or people who trigger your stress then you should do it.Alter: Ask yourself, can I do the same thing in a less stressful way? If yes, then Do it.Accept: For situations beyond our control, consider them as part of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He)’s will and accept them. Develop a sense of gratitude towards Him. The more we thank Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) for what is, the less we get upset for what is not.</p>

<h1>Refraining from consuming alcohol</h1>
<p> The prohibition on alcohol is probably one of Islam's most well-known dietary restrictions, with valid reason. According to health website WebMD.com, not only does alcohol cause cirrhosis of the liver and reduce concentration resulting in accidents, it can also contribute to conditions such as anemia, cancer, cardiovascular disease and even Alzheimer's.</p>
<h1> Refraining from eating pork</h1>
<p>This is another one of Islam's dietary restrictions that would be well known to many. Despite being one of the most consumed meats worldwide, pork introduces various viruses and bacteria in the body, according to healthy living website Livestrong.com. This in turn can contribute to vomiting, fever, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and dehydration, all of which can prove fatal in extreme cases.</p>
<h1>. Practicing moderation in diet</h1>
<p>Islam emphasises moderation - not too much and not too little - in every aspect of life. The second half of verse 31 of Surah Al-A'raf states, "Eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess." A hadith in Tirmizi further advises Muslims to leave "one third of the belly with food, another third with drink and leave one third empty for easy breathing."

    When it comes to our diet, it has been scientifically proven that eating too much can contribute to weight gain and obesity, and all the health concerns stemming from it. Similarly, eating too little can result in your body not receiving the nutrients it needs for proper development and survival.</p>
<h1>. Using toothpicks after every meal</h1>
<p>Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) encouraged his followers to use a tooth pick because "siwaak (toothpick) cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord after every meal." (Sahih al-Bukhari) It cleans out food-buildup in your teeth, preventing decay and reducing the risk of cavities and tooth and gum infections.</p>
<h1> Washing hands before & after meals</h1>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) has strongly advised that one should wash his hands before and after a meal. “It is a blessing to wash your hands before and after meal.” (Abu Daud & Tirmizi)
<h1>Emphasis on personal hygiene</h1>
<p>Islamic teachings lay great emphasis on keeping one's clothes and self clean. Tirmizi, Adab, 41 exhorts, “Certainly, Allah is clean and He likes cleanness.” It is highly advised to clean rubbish, take daily showers and not leave bodily waste out in the open. As the various European plagues of the Middle Ages have shown, not observing these precautions can lead to infestations of insect-spreading rodents.
</p>
<h1>Keeping the lid on utensils</h1>
<p>Stressing on proper care of kitchen utensils, Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) said, “Cover up the utensils and tie the mouth of the water skins.” (Bukhari, Muslim)  This prevents contamination from passing insects and lizards and in houses with open kitchens keeps stray animals away from the food.</p>
<h1>Male circumcision</h1>
<p>Islam makes it compulsory for all Muslim males to be circumcised. According to WebMD.com, male circumcision reduces the risk of urinary tract infections, reduces the risk of sexually transmitted diseases in men, protects against penile cancer, and reduces the risk of cervical cancer in wives.</p>
<h1>Washing after urination and defecation</h1>
<p>In contrast with Western practice, Islamic teachings require followers to wash genitals with water after urination and defecation. This method aids in complete removal of waste matter and associated bacteria, reducing risks of infection.</p>
<h1>Refraining from consuming blood in any form</h1>
<p>Strangely enough, blood that keeps you alive when it flows in your veins can prove toxic if it enters your digestive system, and this is why the zabiha method of slaughter requires blood to be drained from livestock before it is eaten. Blood is rich in iron, which the human digestive system is not designed to handle in large quantities. An iron overdose can cause liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.</p>
    In the same vein, islam.ru states that Prophet (pbuh) has strongly advised not to clean hands with a towel before a meal because it may transmit infections from one person to another.</p>
    <h1>Enjoying some shut-eye in the afternoon</h1>
    <p>Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) was in the habit of sleeping for a while after lunch and encouraged his companions and followers to do the same (Tabrani). Narrated Thumamah ibn Uthal, Anas said, “Um Sulaim used to spread a leather sheet for the Prophet (pbuh) and he used to take a midday nap on that leather sheet at her home.” A short mid-day nap gives relief to the vital organs of the body including the heart and brain.</p>
    <h1>Praying five times a day</h1>
    <p>Apart from the spiritual aspect, praying five times a day at fixed times introduces routine in one's life. The movements involved in the ritual provide a very light form of exercise and keeps the blood circulation going. The arrangement of prayers is such that those at the time of empty stomach are brief but those after meals are longer and give more exercise to the body in order to aid digestion after a heavy meal.
    </p>
    <h1>Treating fever with cold water</h1>
    <p>The practice of applying cold compresses and ice packs to the foreheads of patients suffering from fever has its roots in Islamic tradition. According to Sahih al-Bukhari, "Fever is from the heat of Hell, so put it out (cool it) with water." Elevated body temperatures can prove fatal beyond a certain point, and applications of cold water can bring them down to normal faster.</p>
    <h1>Eating black seeds</h1>
    <p>Islamic teachings insist that black seeds should be a part of your daily diet. Hazrat Abu Hurairah states, “I have heard from Prophet (pbuh) that there is cure for every disease in black seeds except death." In seed or powder form, kalonji can reduce obesity, aid digestion, treat several digestive disorder, reduce blood pressure and treat congestion. Kalonji oil has proved to be effective in reducing joint pain and inflammation.</p>
    <h1>Fasting in the month of Ramadan</h1>
    <p>The medical community is gradually beginning to recognize the medical benefits of refraining from eating for the  better part of the day. Not only can this fasting help us to lose fat, it also gives our digestive system a much-needed and truly well-deserved break. It also increase neuronal autophagy, which means that your brain neurons flush out toxins. However, science has also shown that extending a fast beyond 30-40 days can result in starvation and this is not recommended.</p>
    <h1>Eating a date when breaking the fast</h1>
    <p>Extended hours of not eating and drinking can deplete the body of glucose, which is the body's primary source of energy. Breaking the fast with a date provides a quick and easy way to replenish the body's glucose reserves. Narrated Anas bin Malik, "The Prophet (pbuh) used to break his fast before offering evening prayer with some fresh dates." In case dates are not available, it is strongly advised to drink water, which helps to combat the dehydration caused by a fast.</p>
    <h1>Using honey to treat infections</h1>
    <p>Verse 69 of Surah Al-Nahl in the Quran mentions honey as a source of "healing for mankind", for good reason. Honey offers incredible antiseptic, antioxidant and immune boosting properties for our body and health. It not only fights infection and helps tissue healing but also helps reduce inflammation, even helping to cure coughs and flu, and treat acne.
    </p>
    <h1> Dealing with substance abuse</h1>
    <p>We learn from verses 90 and 91 of Surah Maidah that Islam is opposed to the use of any intoxicants. The detrimental effects of cigarettes are well-documented and there would be hardly anyone who was not well-aware of the harm caused by smoking. In addition, the lives, and in many cases the untimely deaths, of many celebrities are a testament to the devastating effects of substance abuse.</p>
<h1 style="color: orange;">HEALTHY EMOTIONS</h1>
<video width="400" height="400" controls>
    <video src="e.mp4" type="a/mp4"></video>
<h1>Step 1: Recognise and Accept that You Are in Control of Your Emotions</h1>
<p>Islam values the importance of good mental health and emotional wellbeing. The Qur'an can be used as a guide to those suffering from emotional distress and aims to lead people to a meaningful quality of life. 'There is no disease that Allah has created, except that He also has created its treatment' (Hadith).</p>

<p>First, we need to convince ourselves that we are in full control of our emotions. We cannot blame anyone else for any emotion residing inside of us. Of course, there can be external triggers, unexpected events and piled up work. All of these are beyond our control, but what remains within the hold of our fist is how we react to all this craziness.

    It is interesting to note how we tune ourselves to react in a certain way in a given scenario. For instance, we have programmed ourselves to get angry if someone horns at us during traffic rush hour. We have programmed ourselves to shout back if someone uses a harsh tone with us. And interestingly enough, we have programmed ourselves to smile and relax when someone says, “Sorry”.
    
    By doing this, we become a puppet in control of words, tones and scenarios. If we start emotionally detaching ourselves from these triggers that we have programmed ourselves with, we can be more intelligent in crisis situations.

<h1>HEALTH</h1>

<video width="400" height="400" controls>
    <video src="f.mp4" type="a/mp4"></video>
<p>Islam takes a holistic approach to health.  Just as religious life is inseparable from secular life, physical, emotional and spiritual health cannot be separated; they are three parts that make a completely healthy person.  When one part is injured or unhealthy, the other parts suffer.  If a person is physically ill or injured it may be difficult to concentrate on anything but the pain.  If a person is emotionally unwell, he or she may not be able to take care of him or herself properly or find their minds distracted from the realities of life.

    When speaking to his followers Prophet Muhammad spoke of the strong believer being better than a weak believer, in the eyes of God.[1]  The word strong here can mean strength in faith or in character, but it can equally mean health.  Our bodies are a trust from God and we are accountable for how we look after our health.  Although physical and emotional health is important, spiritual health needs to be the first priority in our lives.  If a person is in spiritual difficulty then life can begin to unravel and problems may occur in all areas.
    
    Injury and illness can happen for many reasons, however it is important to acknowledge and accept that nothing happens in this world accept with the permission of God.</p>
    <P>If someone has faith in Allah they shouldn't be depressed or have mental illnesses, should they?

    As a Muslim, you get affected by life’s troubles and disturbing thoughts like everyone else, but you can deal with them much better because you have a clear roadmap of where you came from, where you are going and why, so you have a head start having this fundamental knowledge from its source. (Islam Online Archive, n.d.)
    
    Someone who feels completely lost and alone in the face of a crisis would probably feel helpless and depressed. But someone who feels supported by a compassionate God who genuinely cares, who listens to desperate pleas, and who grants generous help, has a better chance of getting back on track much faster because there is a strong helping hand to reach for while dealing with life’s troubles. (Islam Online Archive, n.d.)
    
    “And for those who fear Allah, He always prepares a way out, and He provides for him from sources he never could imagine. And if anyone puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is Allah for him. For Allah will surely accomplish His purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion.”(Quran, 65: 2-3)</P>
